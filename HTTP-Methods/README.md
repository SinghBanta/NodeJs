HTTP methods
The HTTP method defines the action the client wants to make on the server, which includes creating, reading, updating, or deleting resources (CRUD). 
Here are four HTTP methods that are commonly used in REST APIs:

1.GET: used to retrieve resources.
2.POST: used to add resources.
3.PUT: used to update resources.
4.DELETE: used to delete resources.
