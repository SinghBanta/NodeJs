# CORS(CROSS ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING)

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism that controls how browsers access resources on other domains.
It's used to prevent malicious websites from accessing other sites' data without permission. 
CORS also allows client applications to interact with resources on different domains. 

# How CORS works:

- CORS uses HTTP headers to determine if browsers can access resources from other domains .

- The same-origin security policy normally prevents cross-domain access .

- CORS allows web servers to opt in to allowing cross-domain access.

- The browser checks with third-party servers if a request is authorized before transferring data.
