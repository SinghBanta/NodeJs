# AXIOS and FETCH

Fetch is a built-in API available in the browser, Node. js, and most JS runtimes and serverless environments making it one less dependency for your project.
In contrast, Axios is a third-party library, meaning it requires installation via a package manager or inclusion through a CDN.

Axios performs automatic transforms of JSON data while Fetch is a two-step process when handling JSON data- first, to make the actual request;
second, to call the .json() method on the response.

Fetch and Axios both handle HTTP requests.Axios offers more features like cancellation, progress tracking and JSON handling while 
Fetch being inbuild require no installation and has wide compatibilty accross the browsers.
