# HTTP SERVER
An HTTP server is software that stores, processes, and delivers web content to users. It uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate with clients. 

How it works 

- A user requests a web page or resource using HTTP.
- The HTTP server processes the request.
- The HTTP server sends a response back to the user.
- The user receives the requested content, such as text, images, videos, or applications.
